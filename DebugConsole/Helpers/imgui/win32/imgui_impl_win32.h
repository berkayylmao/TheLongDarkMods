// dear imgui: Platform Binding for Windows (standard windows API for 32 and 64 bits applications)
// This needs to be used along with a Renderer (e.g. DirectX11, OpenGL3, Vulkan..)

// Implemented features:
//  [X] Platform: Clipboard support (for Win32 this is actually part of core imgui)
//  [X] Platform: Mouse cursor shape and visibility. Disable with 'io.ConfigFlags |= ImGuiConfigFlags_NoMouseCursorChange'.
//  [X] Platform: Keyboard arrays indexed using VK_* Virtual Key Codes, e.g. ImGui::IsKeyPressed(VK_SPACE).
//  [X] Platform: Gamepad support. Enabled with 'io.ConfigFlags |= ImGuiConfigFlags_NavEnableGamepad'.

// You may or not need this for your implementation, but it can serve as reference for handling inputs.
// Intentionally commented out to avoid dragging dependencies on <windows.h> types. You can COPY this line into your .cpp code instead.
